Note: Do not export PalindromeDemoArray.java, PalindromeDemoArrayList.java, and PalindromeDemoVector.java, all inside the same directory. 
      Since a stack can be implemented, using an array, array list, or vector; those three classes were all included, inside this folder. 
      To compile everything, using the wildcard, I would recommend including ArrayStack.java, StackInterface.java, and PalindromeDemo.java;
      all inside the working directory. Also, it would be feasible, to rename one, of those three classes, as PalindromeDemo.java.
